# TagRefinery: A Visual Tool for Tag Wrangling
TagRefinery supports you in your task of cleaning and processing open tag spaces. A guided and step-by-step interface allows you to perform efficiently tasks such as spell-correction, multi-word tag detection, and word form consolidation, in a visually supported framework.

The framework is language independent and ships with multiple parameters which allows you to get different kinds of results - like: a smaller and cleaner set of tags in the final output, a strongly reduced set of tags which still covers many of the initial items or inplace spell-correction and word form consolidation in texts.

Those outputs can be used in further steps like in recommendation servives, topic modelling algorithms or any text analysis tool.

## Usage

Download the current version and simple start it by running the correct run_all file. There are example input csv files which show the needed csv headers. 

If the run_all file doesnt work, start the server.jar file per hand and open the index.html (no webserver is needed)
